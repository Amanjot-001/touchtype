            collection of elements, with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop,
            which removes the top element from the stack.
    
            A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last element added to the stack is
            the first one to be removed. In other words, elements are pushed onto the top of the stack and popped off the
            top of the stack in the reverse order in which they were added.
    
            The basic concept of a stack is used in many programming applications, such as handling function calls and
            managing program memory. A stack is often used to store information about function calls, including parameters,
            return addresses, and local variables. When a function is called, the information is pushed onto the stack, and
            when the function returns, the information is popped off the stack.
    
            A stack is also used in programming languages to handle expressions and operator precedence. When an expression
            is evaluated, its components (operands and operators) are pushed onto the stack in the order in which they are
            encountered. When an operator is encountered, the operands are popped from the stack and the result is pushed
            back onto the stack.
    
            In computer memory, a stack is typically implemented using a contiguous block of memory, with a pointer pointing
            to the top of the stack. The push and pop operations manipulate this pointer to add and remove elements from the
            stack.
    
            Overall, a stack is a simple and powerful data structure that is widely used in computer science and
            programming. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a valuable tool for many applications.</p>
